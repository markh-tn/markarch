# Hello. 
This arch install script is just something for me to mess around with.\
This code sucks, (I know) but since I wanna learn bash scripting I'd figure why not mess around with something like this.\
Don't use this.
## If you do want to run this...
**You MUST have UEFI/EFI enabled.**\
In the Arch Linux iso, run this command.
```
bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markh-tn/markarch/main/markarch.sh)
```
Select your preferences, and there you go!
### This script installs the Cinnamon desktop enviroment by default, I may include other DEs in the future.
