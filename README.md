# Hello. 
This is an arch linux installation script.\
I'm just using this repo to maybe get better at scripting.\
Don't seriously use this.
## To run this script
**You MUST have UEFI/EFI enabled.**\
This script assumes you have your internet connection configured.\
In the Arch Linux iso, run this command.
```
bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markh-tn/markarch/main/markarch.sh)
```
Select your preferences, and there you go!\
If you choose to install VirtualBox Guest Additions, the install script will be located at
```
/home/USERNAME/Desktop/VirtualBoxGuestAdditions.sh
```
## Q&A.. kinda.
### "Why so many commits?"
I use this repo as a testing ground. If I want to add something and test it, I will add it to the testing branch and then I will boot up a Arch Linux in a VM and run the same command above but pulling the script from the testing branch.\
I will probably find a better way to do this soon, but for now this is how I'm doing it.
### "ur script sux!!!!11"
Like I previously mentioned, this is my playground. I don't expect this script to be used for anything outside of me or a friend messing around with it.
I'd have no problem if you want to open an issue, I just don't want to add anything too complex.
